# miwokAndroidApp

This app was build in Udacity's Android App Developement fundamental course.
It was focussed on saving native languages by making an app on them.


In this app I learned and implemented following concepts:
  1. Intent and Activities
  2. Java's ArrayList and Custom classes, Array Adapter and View Recycling
  3. Memory Management(making app to consume less RAM, using above concepts)
  4. Android activity lifecycle and Media Player concepts

I have made this app and added my own native language twist:) 

It is also available for download (see wiki of this app).
